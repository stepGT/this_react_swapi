# SWAPI
The Star Wars API https://swapi.dev/ is the world's first quantified and programmatically-formatted set of Star Wars data.

After hours of watching films and trawling through content online, we present to you all the People, Films, Species, Starships, Vehicles and Planets from Star Wars.

We've formatted this data in JSON and exposed it to you in a RESTish implementation that allows you to programmatically collect and measure the data.
